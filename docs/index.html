<h2><a name="1">What is RHDL?</a></h2>
<p>RHDL (Ruby Hardware Description Language) is an HDL based on the
Ruby programming language. My idea in developing RHDL was to build an
HDL
on an object oriented programming language to allow HDL features (
concurrent processes, signals, parallelism etc.) in addition to
features
which come with a modern, object oriented, agile programming language
like
Ruby (<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org%29.">www.ruby-lang.org).</a>
The intent is to allow more than just simulation, but also verification
and testbench creation features. Ultimately, I would like to be able to
translate RHDL to VHDL and/or Verilog.
The fact that RHDL is based on Ruby should allow modeling at a higher
level of
abstraction than is possible with VHDL or Verilog.</p>
<p>RHDL users don't need to know much Ruby - this is intentional, I
didn't want
potential users to have to know Ruby in order to benefit from RHDL.
However,
RHDL becomes a more powerful tool if the user takes a little time to
learn
some Ruby (an excellent tutorial and reference book on Ruby is:
"Programming
Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide" by Thomas and Hunt.)</p>
<p>RHDL is not stricly speaking a new language. It is a set of modules
(code
libraries) that allow Ruby to look like an HDL. Ruby has a concept
called
code blocks; these blocks are made into lexically scoped closures in
order
to define a domain specific language like RHDL without having to write
a seperate parser.</p>
<h2><a name="2">Why? </a></h2>
<p>Good question. Initially I created RHDL as a proof of concept and to
demonstrate the power of Ruby for creating domain specific languages. </p>
<p>Scripting languages like Ruby (I prefer to call them agile
programming languages since they are full-featured, dynamic programming
languages) allow developers to develop at a higher level than is
possible with statically typed languages like C, C++ or Java. This
leads to greater productivity. I suspect that bringing some of these
cocepts into the HDL world can also lead to greater productivity over
the current crop of HDLs. </p>
<h2><a name="3">What's it good for?</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Teaching HDL concepts including internal simulation concepts (the
full source code is available and it is relatively small)</li>
  <li>As a high-level verification language (HVL) (with a few more
additions)</li>
</ul>
