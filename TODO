** TODO prior to 0.5.0:

+ add more test cases
+ add info to the UsersGuide and add a RHDL Class reference document
+ add LXT output for use with GtkWave (waveform viewer)


** TODO longterm:

+ Improve performance: Yeah, it's slow (and it gets slower as you add more signals and designs).  I'm thinking that parts of RHDL could be rewritten in C to significantly improve performance, but first I want to build up more testcases to ensure that nothing breaks.
+ Improve the simulation interface: maybe add arguments to step or perhaps add iterators to TestBenches.
+ Add more high-level features: Protocols
+ Distributed simulation? (using Drb and/or TaskMaster)
+ An interface to Icarus Verilog?
+ conversion of RHDL designs to VHDL/Verilog
