RHDL - Ruby Hardware Description Language

RHDL looks similar to VHDL - there are processes which can have sensitivity 
lists, and signals.

In the examples subdirectory you'll find a couple of examples: 
counter.rb and structural.rb
(the other examples there are 'old-style' RHDL and have not been updated 
to the new style yet, so don't bother with them for now)


To run the counter example:

> ruby counter.rb

Other examples which are now up to date:

./examples/structural.rb
./examples/state_machine.rb
./examples/dff.rb
./examples/latch.rb
(also see: ./lib/hardware/RHDL/clkgen.rb for the clock generator example)

NOTE: docs are not currently up to date.
