RHDL - Ruby Hardware Description Language

RHDL looks similar to VHDL - there are processes which can have sensitivity 
lists, and signals.

In the examples subdirectory you'll find a couple of examples: 
counter.rb and structural.rb
(the other examples there are 'old-style' RHDL and have not been updated 
to the new style yet, so don't bother with them for now)


To run the counter example:

> ruby counter.rb
