RHDL - Ruby Hardware Description Language

RHDL looks similar to VHDL - there are processes which can have sensitivity 
lists, and signals.

In the examples subdirectory you'll find a couple of examples with
RUNIT testcases.

The example in testsimple.rb file defines a counter which increments on 
the rising edge of clk.  It also has a synchronous reset so that if the 
rst signal is high on the rising edge of clk, counter gets reset to 0.

To run the testsimple example:

> ruby testsimple.rb


The input vectors and expected output for this testcase are contained
in the file 'simple_data'.
